# About me

## Who am I?

Aspiring computer guy. That sounds vague and a weird way to put it but I have yet to find what i want to specialise in ( except csss and html as I lack a single drop of any visual creativity).

## Why am I here ? (on GitHub)

 Avid lover of solving problems and I think that this platform is a brillant way to showcase and make the process of tackling complex issues much simpler
